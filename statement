I agree that I will not store any sensitive personally identifiable information ("PII") on this cloud service. 
This means I will not store details about a person, such as age, date of birth, address, drivers licence, national insurance number, phone numbers, religion nor any financial details about them.

Using a person's name is fine, or their published office phone number, or work email, as it is non-sensitive.
No sensitive PII should be stored here.
